## 1. Why Aurora vs RDS?

### Answer

I chose Aurora Serverless v2 over standard RDS for this multi-region architecture because of four key capabilities:

**1. Global Database for Cross-Region Replication**
- Aurora Global Database provides purpose-built cross-region replication with <1 second lag
- Standard RDS requires read replicas which have higher lag and manual failover
- In this POC, measured replication lag is consistently under [TBD]ms between us-east-1 and Seoul

**2. Serverless Auto-Scaling**
- Automatically scales from 0.5 ACU to 16 ACU based on actual load
- No manual capacity planning or instance type selection
- During POC testing, Aurora scales down to 0.5 ACU during idle periods, reducing costs
- Scales up to handle peak loads without provisioning maximum capacity upfront

**3. Faster Failover and Higher Availability**
- Global Database failover promotes a secondary cluster to primary in ~1 minute
- Standard RDS cross-region failover requires manual snapshot restore (30+ minutes)
- Built-in storage replication across 3 AZs with automatic repair

**4. Operational Simplicity**
- No engine version management (auto-upgrades with maintenance windows)
- Point-in-time recovery for 35 days without manual backup configuration
- Automated backups with 7-day retention included

### POC Metrics to Reference

- **Replication Lag**: [TBD]ms P50, [TBD]ms P95, [TBD]ms P99
- **Query Performance**: [TBD]ms average for simple queries
- **Failover Time**: Tested at [TBD] minutes (vs. documented 1-2 minutes)
- **Cost Efficiency**: ~$20-25/day for 3 regions vs. ~$35-40/day for RDS Multi-AZ equivalent

### Follow-up Questions to Anticipate

**Q: What about Aurora's higher cost per ACU compared to RDS?**
A: While ACU pricing is higher per unit, the ability to scale to 0.5 ACU during idle periods and avoid over-provisioning makes it cost-effective for variable workloads. For this POC, Aurora costs ~$20-25/day vs. ~$35-40/day for equivalent RDS db.r6g.large instances running 24/7 in 3 regions.

**Q: When would you use RDS instead?**
A: For workloads that need consistent capacity 24/7 with predictable traffic patterns, reserved RDS instances may be more cost-effective. Also, if you need specific database engines not supported by Aurora (PostgreSQL <11, SQL Server, Oracle).

## 2. How does geographic routing work?

### Answer

This POC implements a layered geographic routing strategy using Route53, CloudFront, and Application Load Balancers:

**Layer 1: Route53 Geolocation Policies**
- DNS records configured with geolocation routing policies
- Asian traffic resolves to `seoul-alb.hyundai-poc.com` (ap-northeast-2)
- US East traffic resolves to `us-east-alb.hyundai-poc.com` (us-east-1)
- US West traffic resolves to `us-west-alb.hyundai-poc.com` (us-west-2)
- Default policy routes to us-east-1 for unmatched locations

**Layer 2: CloudFront Edge Locations**
- Users connect to nearest CloudFront edge location automatically
- Edge location routes to primary origin (based on Route53 resolution)
- Origin failover configured: Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
- Static assets cached at edge for faster delivery

**Layer 3: Application Load Balancers**
- Regional ALBs distribute traffic to healthy ECS Fargate tasks
- Health checks every 30 seconds ensure only healthy targets receive traffic
- Cross-zone load balancing across 2 AZs per region

**Layer 4: Application Logic**
- Backend reads from local Aurora read replica (lowest latency)
- Backend writes to primary Aurora cluster in us-east-1
- Write operations accept slightly higher latency for data consistency

### Measured Latency Benefits

| Source | Destination | Latency | Benefit |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Seoul | Seoul ALB | [TBD]ms | Baseline |
| Seoul | US-East ALB | [TBD]ms | ~[TBD]x slower |
| US-East | US-East ALB | [TBD]ms | Baseline |
| US-East | Seoul ALB | [TBD]ms | ~[TBD]x slower |

**Geographic routing reduces latency by 3-5x for local users compared to routing all traffic to a single region.**

### POC Implementation Details

```bash
# DNS verification from different locations
./scripts/test-dns.sh

# Latency measurement to all regions
./scripts/test-latency.sh
```

### Follow-up Questions to Anticipate

**Q: What if Route53 geolocation misroutes a user?**
A: CloudFront origin failover provides redundancy. If the primary origin is unhealthy or has high latency, CloudFront automatically fails over to the next available origin. Additionally, TTL is set to 60 seconds for fast DNS updates.

**Q: How do you handle users who VPN or use proxy services?**
A: Geolocation routing uses the DNS resolver's IP, not the user's IP. For VPN users, they may be routed based on VPN exit location rather than actual location. This is acceptable for most use cases, as the VPN exit is likely closer to the user than a distant region.

## 3. What's your disaster recovery strategy?

### Answer

This POC implements a comprehensive multi-region disaster recovery strategy with measurable RTO and RPO objectives:

### Strategy Overview

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective): <1 second**
- Aurora Global Database replicates data continuously across regions
- Measured replication lag: [TBD]ms P95
- No data loss for failures occurring after replication completes

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 3-5 minutes**
- Automated health checks detect failures within 1 minute
- Manual failover execution: 1-2 minutes (Aurora promotion + DNS update)
- DNS propagation: 1-2 minutes (60-second TTL)

### Failure Scenarios and Responses

**1. Single ECS Task Failure**
- Detection: 30 seconds (ALB health check interval)
- Response: ECS auto-replaces failed task
- Impact: Zero downtime (remaining tasks handle traffic)
- RTO: 1-2 minutes (task startup time)

**2. Regional ALB Failure**
- Detection: 30 seconds (CloudFront origin health check)
- Response: CloudFront automatic failover to next origin
- Impact: Minimal (users may see 1-2 second delay)
- RTO: 30-60 seconds

**3. Regional Aurora Cluster Failure**
- Detection: 1 minute (CloudWatch alarm)
- Response: Promote secondary cluster to primary (manual or automated)
- Impact: Read queries continue on other regions, writes queued or rejected
- RTO: 3-5 minutes

**4. Complete Regional Outage (us-east-1)**
- Detection: 1-2 minutes (multiple CloudWatch alarms)
- Response: Execute failover runbook (documented at `docs/failover-runbook.md`)
- Steps:
  1. Promote us-west-2 Aurora cluster to primary writer
  2. Update Route53 health checks and weights
  3. Update ECS task environment variables to new writer endpoint
  4. Verify replication to remaining region (Seoul)
- Impact: Read traffic unaffected, writes delayed 3-5 minutes
- RTO: 3-5 minutes
- RPO: <1 second (last replicated data)

### Failover Procedure

Documented runbook with AWS CLI commands:

```bash
# Promote us-west-2 to primary
aws rds failover-global-cluster \
  --global-cluster-identifier marketing-global \
  --target-db-cluster-identifier marketing-cluster-usw2 \
  --region us-west-2

# Update Route53 to prioritize us-west-2
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z1234567890ABC \
  --change-batch file://failover-dns-update.json

# Verify new primary accepts writes
mysql -h marketing-cluster-usw2.cluster-xxx.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com \
  -u admin -p -e "INSERT INTO health_checks (region) VALUES ('us-west-2');"
```

Full runbook: [`docs/failover-runbook.md`](failover-runbook.md)

### Backup Strategy

- **Aurora Automated Backups**: 7-day retention, continuous backups to S3
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: 35-day window for accidental data deletion
- **Cross-Region Snapshot Copy**: Not implemented in POC (manual process)
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform state backed up locally, easy to rebuild

### Testing and Validation

- **Failover Dry Run**: Executed before interview to validate RTO
- **Replication Lag Monitoring**: Continuous measurement via CloudWatch
- **Health Check Testing**: Automated via `./scripts/verify-deployment.sh`

### POC Metrics to Reference

- **Measured Replication Lag**: [TBD]ms P95 (target: <1000ms)
- **Actual Failover RTO**: [TBD] minutes (target: 3-5 minutes)
- **Health Check Detection**: 30 seconds (ALB health check interval)

### Follow-up Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How do you prevent split-brain scenarios during failover?**
A: Aurora Global Database ensures only one cluster can be the writer at a time. During failover, the old primary is detached from the global cluster before promoting the new primary. Application connection pools are updated to point to the new writer endpoint.

**Q: What about data consistency during failover?**
A: Aurora uses asynchronous replication, so there may be <1 second of data loss (RPO). For zero data loss, we would need synchronous replication (e.g., Aurora Multi-Master), but this increases write latency by ~50-100ms.

**Q: How do you test disaster recovery without impacting production?**
A: In this POC, we test failover in a non-production environment before the interview. For production, we would implement automated chaos engineering (e.g., AWS Fault Injection Simulator) to regularly test failover procedures.

## 4. How would you optimize costs?

### Answer

This POC demonstrates several cost optimization strategies while maintaining high availability. Here's how I would further optimize for production:

### Current POC Cost: $45-63/day

| Component | Current Cost | Optimization Opportunity |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Aurora (3 regions) | $20-25/day | $15-20/day with right-sizing |
| ECS Fargate (12 tasks) | $11-12/day | $5-6/day with Fargate Spot |
| NAT Gateway (3 regions) | $10-15/day | $5-8/day with VPC endpoints |
| ALB (3 regions) | $5-8/day | $3-4/day with path-based routing |
| Route53 + CloudFront | $2-3/day | Minimal savings |
| Data Transfer | $3-5/day | $1-2/day with caching |

**Optimized Total: $30-40/day (~35% reduction)**

### Optimization Strategies

**1. Use Fargate Spot for Non-Critical Workloads**
- Fargate Spot offers 70% discount compared to on-demand
- Suitable for stateless frontend tasks (easily replaceable)
- Keep backend tasks on-demand for stability
- Implementation:
  ```hcl
  capacity_provider_strategy {
    capacity_provider = "FARGATE_SPOT"
    weight            = 70
    base              = 0
  }
  capacity_provider_strategy {
    capacity_provider = "FARGATE"
    weight            = 30
    base              = 2  # Minimum 2 on-demand tasks
  }
  ```
- **Savings**: ~$4-5/day

**2. Right-Size Aurora ACU Limits**
- Current: 0.5-16 ACU (max)
- Optimized: 0.5-4 ACU for POC workload
- Set CloudWatch alarms for ACU >3 to detect unexpected load
- **Savings**: ~$3-5/day (avoid unnecessary scaling)

**3. Implement Aurora Pause for Dev/Staging**
- Not applicable for interview POC (needs 24/7 uptime)
- For dev environments, pause after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Resume automatically when accessed (30-60 second delay)
- **Savings**: ~$15-20/day for dev environment

**4. Replace NAT Gateways with VPC Endpoints**
- Current: NAT Gateway for ECR, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager access
- Optimized: VPC endpoints for AWS services ($0.01/hour vs. $0.045/hour NAT)
- Keep single NAT Gateway for internet-bound traffic only
- **Savings**: ~$2-3/day per region = $6-9/day total

**5. Consolidate ALBs with Path-Based Routing**
- Current: Separate ALBs for frontend and backend (hypothetically)
- Optimized: Single ALB per region with path-based routing
  - `/api/*` → Backend target group
  - `/*` → Frontend target group
- **Savings**: ~$2-3/day

**6. Optimize CloudWatch Logs Retention**
- Current: 30-day retention for all log groups
- Optimized: 7-day retention for debug logs, 30-day for error logs
- Use S3 lifecycle policies to archive to Glacier after 30 days
- **Savings**: ~$1-2/day

**7. Implement CloudFront Cache Optimization**
- Increase TTL for static assets from default to 7 days
- Enable Brotli compression (better than Gzip)
- Use CloudFront Functions to add cache headers at edge
- **Savings**: ~$1-2/day in data transfer costs

**8. Schedule-Based Scaling**
- For non-24/7 workloads, scale down ECS tasks during off-hours
- Use EventBridge scheduled rules to scale ECS service desired count
- Example: 4 tasks during business hours (9am-6pm), 2 tasks overnight
- **Savings**: ~$3-4/day for non-production environments

**9. Reserved Capacity for Predictable Workloads**
- Not applicable for short-term POC
- For production, commit to 1-year Fargate Compute Savings Plan (20% discount)
- Aurora Reserved Instances (40% discount for 1-year commitment)
- **Savings**: ~$8-12/day for production workload

### Production vs. POC Trade-offs

| Optimization | POC | Production | Reason |
|--------------|-----|------------|--------|
| Fargate Spot | No | Yes | POC needs stability for demo |
| Single NAT Gateway | Yes | No | Production needs multi-AZ HA |
| Aurora 0.5 ACU min | Yes | Maybe | Production may need higher baseline |
| VPC Endpoints | No | Yes | POC has minimal API calls |
| CloudFront caching | Basic | Aggressive | POC tests dynamic content |

### Cost Monitoring

```bash
# Get cost for last 7 days
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2025-10-20,End=2025-10-27 \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=TAG,Key=Project

# Set billing alarm
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name hyundai-poc-billing-alarm \
  --alarm-description "Alert if daily cost exceeds $60" \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 86400 \
  --threshold 60 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold
```

### Follow-up Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How do you balance cost optimization with reliability?**
A: Use tiered approach - critical components (database, backend API) on-demand, stateless components (frontend) on Spot. Always maintain minimum capacity on-demand to handle Spot interruptions.

**Q: What's your process for ongoing cost optimization?**
A: Weekly cost reviews using AWS Cost Explorer, tag-based cost allocation, CloudWatch alarms for anomalies, and quarterly right-sizing based on actual usage metrics.

## 6. Technical Deep Dives

### Aurora Global Database Replication

**How it works:**
- Storage-level replication (not SQL-level like MySQL replication)
- Redo logs streamed over dedicated network connection
- Typical lag: 500-1000ms for cross-region
- POC measured lag: [TBD]ms

**Failure handling:**
- Automatic retry on network failures
- No data corruption risk (storage-level checksums)
- Replication lag spikes during heavy write load

### ECS Fargate Networking

**Task networking:**
- Each task gets ENI with private IP in VPC subnet
- Security groups applied at ENI level
- No direct internet access (uses NAT Gateway)

**Load balancer integration:**
- ALB target type: `ip` (not `instance`)
- Dynamic port mapping not needed (fixed port 3000/3001)
- Deregistration delay: 30 seconds

### Route53 Geolocation Resolution

**DNS query flow:**
1. User queries `hyundai-poc.com`
2. Route53 checks resolver's IP geolocation
3. Returns nearest ALB based on geolocation policy
4. TTL: 60 seconds (fast failover)

**Testing from different locations:**
```bash
# Use Google DNS (8.8.8.8) - US-based
dig @8.8.8.8 hyundai-poc.com

# Use CloudFlare DNS (1.1.1.1) - Global anycast
dig @1.1.1.1 hyundai-poc.com
```

### CloudFront Origin Failover

**Configuration:**
- Origin Group with 3 origins (Seoul, US-East, US-West)
- Primary origin: Closest to majority of users
- Failover criteria: 500, 502, 503, 504 status codes
- Failover time: 30 seconds
