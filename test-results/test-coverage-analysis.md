## Gap Analysis: What We Did NOT Test

### Intentionally Out of Scope (Per POC Requirements)

| Area | Reason for Exclusion |
|------|---------------------|
| Performance load testing | POC demonstrates functionality, not scale |
| Stress testing | Infrastructure auto-scales; load testing not required |
| Edge case error scenarios | Focus on happy path for demonstration |
| Security penetration testing | Not required for POC environment |
| Multi-user concurrency | Single-user demonstration sufficient |
| Cost optimization strategies | Infrastructure will be destroyed after interview |
| Comprehensive error handling | Basic error handling sufficient |
| Blue-green deployment | Direct ECS updates acceptable for POC |
| Automated failover | Manual failover demonstrates understanding |
| VPN/bastion host access | Direct access acceptable for temporary POC |

### Acceptable Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Geographic testing limited to current location | Cannot test all geolocation routing scenarios | Use online DNS checkers, document expected behavior |
| DNS requires domain registration | May not have custom domain | Use ALB DNS names directly, show Route53 configuration |
| Replication lag varies | Results may differ between test runs | Execute multiple cycles, use P95 metric |
| Failover dry run optional | May not have measured RTO | Runbook provides detailed steps and expected timing |
